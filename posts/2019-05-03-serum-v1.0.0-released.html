…and finally, I’m so excited to announce the release of Serum v1.0.0! Many
thanks to those who have shown their interests in this project for a long time,
and especially, to those who have contributed to Serum through issues and pull
requests on GitHub! 🎉🎉🎉</p><h2 id="what’s-next?">What’s Next?</h2><h3 id="themes!">Themes!</h3><p>Supporting themes has been the most wanted feature of Serum for a long, long
time. However, I could not implement this because the quality of its code base
was not so good. For recent several months, lots of codes got through massive
overhaul and refactoring, and now it has became more feasible to implement
Serum Themes™. Supports for themes will become available before Serum v1.1.0
or v1.2.0.</p><h3 id="“awesome-serum”">“Awesome Serum”</h3><p>Also, I’m planning to make a handcrafted list of user-created Serum plugins.
If you created some awesome plugins, and if you want anyone around the world to
try your plugins, publish them to Hex.pm and let me know!</p></div></article></main>
