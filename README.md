# Serum

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dalgona/Serum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dalgona/Serum)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Dalgona/Serum/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Dalgona/Serum?branch=master)

**Serum** is a simple static website generator written in
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).

Like some of other static website generators, Serum focuses on blogging. And if
you know how to write markdown documents and how to handle EEx templates, you
can easily build your own website.

## ðŸš§ CURRENT STATUS OF THIS REPOSITORY ðŸš§

Codes in the `master` branch are currently undergoing **_HUGE_** changes toward
"Serum 2.0," so don't expect anything would work properly. Also, I'm not going
to accept any issue or pull request regarding "Serum 2.0" until things are
kinda ready.

In the meantime, since codes for the existing Serum 1.x versions are still
maintained in the `v1` branch, you are welcome to open any issue or pull
request related to Serum 1.x. Just make sure you set the target base branch
to `v1`, not `master`, when opening pull requests.

I apologize for your inconvenience!

## Getting Started

Use Mix to install the Serum installer archive from Hex.

```sh
$ mix archive.install hex serum_new
```

You can now use `serum.new` Mix task to create a new Serum project.

```sh
$ mix serum.new /path/to/new_website
```

`cd` into the new project directory and install Serum.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/new_website
$ mix do deps.get, deps.compile
```

Try building the website, or spin up the development server.

```sh
# Your website will be built at /path/to/new_website/site
$ mix serum.build

# Your website will be built and served at http://localhost:8080
$ mix serum.server
```
